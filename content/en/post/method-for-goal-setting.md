# My Method for Goal Setting

This is the method that I came up with for goal setting although I wouldn’t claim it as mine but a compilation of all different methods I have studied, simplified and made my own. I always focus on practicality, applicability and simplicity.

## Steps

### 1. Set a Goal
May be ambitious or simple. There are no rules for choosing a goal, just whatever you want to achieve.

**Real Example**  
I want my business to generate $100,000,000.00 MXN ($100 Million pesos x year) in revenue. Currently $40,000,000.00 ($40 Million pesos x year).  

So the goal is to generate a $100 Million MXN Revenue.

### 2. Set a Time Frame
My time frame is December 2027.  

As I need to more than double my current revenue I am giving myself enough time for the goal to be realistic.

### 3. Break Down the Goal
Break down the goal as much as necessary, but without over complicating it.

So right now we are getting a revenue of $40 million a year so that’s $3.3 Million MXN x month.  
Our goal is to get to $100 Million a year that’s $8.3 Million x month.  
We need to increase our revenue by 2.5X.

In 2025 we had 161 shipments that made us the current revenue.  
That is 13.41 shipments x month.  
We need to increase by 2.5x to reach our goals.

161 × 2.5 = 402.5 x year  
13.41 × 2.5 = 33.525 x month  
33.41 - 13.52 = 19.89 more x month

We need to be handling 33.5 shipments x month.

The current revenue has been generated with 50 active customers.

So technically and just as a rough estimate, we would need to increase our active customer base by…

50 × 2.5 = 125  

125 - 50 = 75

So we need 75 new customers from today to December 2027, that is 2 years.

75 new customers is an objective goal that we can put a plan of action in place to accomplish.

So we go at it again…

Since we have 2 years to accomplish this that is 24 months.

75 / 24 = 3.125  

So we need to round up as there are no fractions in customers haha.

**We need 4 customers x month.**

So now we can put a plan of action to get 4 new customers x month and that will take us to our goal.

### 4. Plan of Action
Put together a plan of action.

This will take me a different study to resolve and analyze what would be the best plan of action for us.
