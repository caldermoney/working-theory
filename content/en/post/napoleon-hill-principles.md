## 1. Desire

You would not have a desire unless you are capable of achieving it.  
Firmly establish in your mind what you most desire.

<div class="spacer-xl"></div>


### 6 Steps to Develop Desire

1. Fix in your mind the exact amount or thing you desire.
2. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for that desire.
3. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess what you desire.
4. Create a definite plan and begin at once.
5. Write a concise statement of the amount of money (or goal), time limit, what you intend to give in return, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.
6. Read the statement aloud (morning and night). Feel it and believe it.

## 2. Faith

Faith is a state of mind that can be induced by affirmation or repeated instruction to the mind using auto-suggestion.

### Self-Confidence Formula

1. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life. Therefore, I demand of myself persistent, continuous action towards its attainment, and I here and now promise to take such action.

2. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action and gradually transform themselves into physical reality. Therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes daily upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.

3. I know through the principle of autosuggestion that any desire I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object. Therefore, I will devote 10 minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of self-confidence.

4. I have clearly written down a description of my Definite Chief Aim in life. I will never stop trying until I have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.

5. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure unless built upon truth and justice. Therefore, I will engage in no transaction that does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism by developing love for all humanity because I know that a negative attitude towards others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.

   I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full faith that it will gradually influence my thoughts and actions so that I will become a self-reliant and successful person.

## 3. Auto-Suggestion

Through repeated suggestion, you can put your subconscious mind to work for you.  

The faculty of being able to concentrate your conscious mind on a burning desire until your subconscious mind accepts it as fact.  

Repeat your desire statement 2 times a day.  

Place a written copy where you can see it as often as possible.
