> “A sale is the transference of emotion...”
<div class="spacer-xl"></div>


## CERTAINTY

Since sales are the transference of emotions, you need a **high level of certainty** in your product or service and transfer that to your prospect.

- Rate your level of certainty in your product or service from 1 to 10. (You should always be at **10**).
- Achieve this through **auto-suggestion**.


### Auto-Suggestion Technique
- Make a hard fist with both hands and shout a positive affirmation (e.g., “Yes, I can!” or any empowering short sentence).
- Put strong emotion and intent into each affirmation.

To close the sale, you must raise the prospect’s certainty to **10** (or very close) in **three key areas**:

### The Three Tens
1. The prospect must **love your product**.
2. The prospect must **trust and connect with you**.
3. The prospect must **trust and connect with your company**.

Your job as a salesperson is to transfer certainty to a **10** in all three areas.

As a salesperson, you must control your **physiological and emotional states** to project:

- Certainty
- Clarity
- Courage
- Confidence

These raise the prospect’s certainty in you, your company, and your product.

### Physiological/Emotional States and Their Counterparts
1. Certainty ↔ Uncertainty
2. Clarity ↔ Overwhelm
3. Courage ↔ Fear
4. Confidence ↔ Self-Doubt  
   *(The first four are most important for sales)*
5. Compassion ↔ Cruelty
6. Love ↔ Hate
7. Patience ↔ Impatience
8. Happiness ↔ Misery

## 12 Worlds for Success You Need to Master

There are **two worlds** you must balance for true success — you cannot go far in one without the other:

### Inner World
1. **State Management** – Master your emotional states to reach empowerment.
2. **Beliefs** – Eliminate limiting beliefs and develop empowering ones.
3. **Vision Focus** – Where do I see myself in 5 years? And **why** does it matter to me?
4. **Standards** – Your standards are what you settle for. Replace “should” with **MUST**.  
   Vision and standards must be congruent — if you have a big vision, you must do the work.

### Outer World
1. **Entrepreneurship** – Learn the rules of business (failing elegantly, succeeding wildly).
2. **Marketing** – Offline and online.
3. **Sales and Persuasion/Influence**
4. **MSI** – Multiple Streams of Income

## The Straight Line System

You must **line up the Three Tens** during the conversation and guide the prospect to certainty level **10**.

**Key rule:** Stay **in control** of the conversation.

### Steps of the Straight Line System
1. **Intro** (First 4 seconds on the phone)  
   Establish that you are:  
   - Sharp as a tack  
   - Enthusiastic as hell  
   - An expert in your field  

   Achieve this through:  
   - **Tonality** (grunts, noises to show listening; build rapport by sounding caring)  
   - **Body Language**  
   - Focused professionalism

2. **Instant Rapport**

3. **Intelligence Gathering**  
   - Ask qualifying questions.  
   - Stay on the straight line.

4. **Powerful Transition**  
   - Move from gathering info to presentation.  
   - Don’t sell the product — sell the **positive story** the prospect will have with it.  
   *Example:* “Based on everything you’ve just told me, this is the perfect fit for you/your business.”

5. **Presentation**  
   - In **one powerful sentence**, describe the best way to present your product/service and the story it creates.

6. **Ask for the Order**  
   - Present a clear call to action.

7. **Loop**  
   - Restart at step 5 after objections.  
   - Prepare for objections: after the first, loop with a new angle; after the second, loop again.  
   - Make **three presentations** — the 2nd builds on the 1st, the 3rd on the 2nd.  
   *Example loop:* “I hear what you’re saying, John, but let me ask you a question — does the idea make sense to you?” (If yes) → Loop to 2nd presentation.

## Straight Line Syntax Summary
1. Intro (first 4 seconds)
2. Instant rapport
3. Gather intelligence
4. Powerful transition
5. Product/service presentation (fast, powerful, direct speech)
6. Ask for the order (first time)
7. Deflect objection & loop (e.g., “I hear you, John… does the idea make sense?” → 2nd presentation)

## 5 Core Elements of Human Influence
1. Love your product.
2. Trust in yourself.
3. Trust in your company.
4. **Action Threshold** – People have different thresholds; lower it by asking “What’s the worst that could happen?” and showing it’s not bad (use guarantees, hijack mental movies).
5. **Pain Threshold**

## 10 Basic Tonal Patterns
Match your tonality and body language to what you’re saying to transfer emotion:

1. Certainty
2. Sincerity
3. Reasonable man
4. Scarcity/Urgency
5. Money aside
6. Question vs. Declarative
7. I care / I feel your pain
8. Implied obviousness
9. I really want to know
10. Mystery / Intrigue

Raise or lower your tonality accordingly.
