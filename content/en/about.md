A blog: a regularly updated website or web page, typically run by an individual or small group, written in an informal or conversational style.

According to the dictionary, this is a blog.

About what?
I don’t know.

I regularly take notes and write things in my notebook. After a while, I clean it up and throw those notes away. The thoughts disappear, even if they were written for my future self. It feels like a waste.

This is a way to keep them.
To archive ideas, notes, and studies instead of losing them.

Everything here is coded and hosted by me. That’s intentional. This space is as much about thinking and writing as it is about building, experimenting, and learning along the way.
